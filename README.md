# BIO
Hello I am Shapsty,
I am interested in a lot of things, mostly with science, languages, computer languages, and math.
Currently I am working on learning java for making minecraft mods for me and my friends.
I know basic java, basic python, english, almost no spanish; I can kind of read spanish and understand what people are saying in spanish but I cannot speak it.

You can contact me at my email: shapsty@gmail.com; my discord: Shapsty#3001; my reddit: nooys;
