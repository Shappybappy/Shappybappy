Hello I am Shapsty,
I am interested in a lot of things, mostly with science, languages, computer languages, etc.
Currently I am working on learning java for making minecraft mods for me and my friends.
I know very basic java, some python, english, very little spanish; I can kind of read spanish and understand what people are saying in spanish but I cannot speak it.
